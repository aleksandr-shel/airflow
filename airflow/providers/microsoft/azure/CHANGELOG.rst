3.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.

* ``Fixes AzureFileShare connection extras (#16388)``

``Azure Container Volume`` and ``Azure File Share`` have now dedicated connection types with editable
UI fields. You should not use ``Wasb`` connection type any more for those connections. Names of
connection ids for those hooks/operators were changed to reflect that.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* ``add oracle  connection link (#15632)``
* ``Add delimiter argument to WasbHook delete_file method (#15637)``

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``Fix colon spacing in ``AzureDataExplorerHook`` docstring (#15841)``

   * ``More documentation update for June providers release (#16405)``
   * ``Synchronizes updated changelog after buggfix release (#16464)``

2.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Removes unnecessary AzureContainerInstance connection type (#15514)``

This change removes ``azure_container_instance_default`` connection type and replaces it with the
``azure_default``. The problem was that AzureContainerInstance was not needed as it was exactly the
same as the plain "azure" connection, however it's presence caused duplication in the field names
used in the UI editor for connections and unnecessary warnings generated. This version uses
plain Azure Hook and connection also for Azure Container Instance. If you already have
``azure_container_instance_default`` connection created in your DB, it will continue to work, but
the first time you edit it with the UI you will have to change it's type to ``azure_default``.
